<h1>Project 2: Restaurant Critique</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.25em !important;">I looked at some very popular restaurant chains' websites to see how each one is laid out aesthetically and practically.</h2>

		<h2><a href="https://olivegarden.com">Olive Garden</a></h2>

		<a href="http://olivegarden.com"><img src="olivegarden desktop and mobile.png" alt="olive garden desktop and mobile"></a>

		<p>Olive Garden's homepage really grabs my attention in two ways: 1. Instantly offers a promo for a free appetizer or dessert with 2 entr√©es when I sign up with their eCLUB, and 2. Has a slideshow showcasing specials with great pictures of the food. The grid design is very neat and organized, but it seems to be very narrow in its desktop design.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://texasroadhouse.com">Texas Roadhouse</a></h2>

		<a href="https://texasroadhouse.com"><img src="texasroadhouse desktop and mobile.png" alt="texas roadhouse desktop and mobile"></a>

		<p>Texas Roadhouse's website is not as food-heavy on the pictures shown on the home page unlike Olive Garden. They try to have a more welcoming invitation to their franchise by having a Valentine's day message and heartwarming pictures to pull customers in. Seems a little bland and not as eye catching as some of the other websites.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://redlobster.com">Red Lobster</a></h2>

		<a href="https://redlobster.com"><img src="redlobster desktop and mobile.png" alt="red lobster desktop and mobile"></a>

		<p>Red Lobster's website's grid design uses a "rectangle" design for each panel, which puts a lot of emphasis on the food in the background. The main issue I have with that type of design choice is the lack of resolution in the pictures they use. Great concept, slightly bad execution. The different headers at the top are simplistic, yet practical. </p>

		<h2><a href="https://outback.com">Outback Steakhouse</a></h2>
	
		<a href="https://outback.com"><img src="outback steakhouse desktop and mobile.png" alt="outback steakhouse desktop and mobile"></a>

		<p>Outback Steakhouse's website design is very nice by having an equal representation of food and regular information and/or promos. The navigation buttons work as intended, and the grid system going down the home page are laid out with practicality in mind by having the more popular tabs on top with other miscellaneous ones such as gift cards, locations, donation organizations, and sign up after. The mobile app's layout is awful mainly because it puts a sign up in front of your face and there is no way around it to get to the main website from what I tried. </p>
