	<h1>Design Brief</h1>
	
	<p><b>Design Objective</b>: To have a portfolio that is able to showcase my design/artistic skills, outline the process behind the final product and how I got there, and leave a marking impression on the visitor/employer. The way my work is shown is the most important part about the design because it is my foot in the door in almost all hiring situations.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Audience</b>: Individuals, employers, and/or companies that would like to have a visual representation of what I am able to offer and bring to the table.</p>
	
	<p><b>Design Layout</b>: Simplistic and clean design to allow the work to grab the visitor's eye the most. I am going for a dark background so it is easier on the eye to view from different screens and different times of the day. Most of the work on the website will be mainly one skill type (drawing, 3D modeling, etc.) because it is important that the visitor knows my strong suits and what I am best at and not just what I am good at. I will most likely try to have a separate section that showcases the other skill types and work for those.</p>
