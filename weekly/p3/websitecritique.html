<h1>Project 3: Website Critiques</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.25em !important;">I looked at various portfolio websites from individuals in the gaming industry that have different skills like character art, environmental art, and animation.</h2>

		<h2><a href="http://lancewilkinson.weebly.com">Lance Wilkinson: Character Artist</a></h2>

		<a href="http://lancewilkinson.weebly.com"><img src="lancewilkinson.png" alt="lancewilkinson"></a>

		<p>Lance's portfolio is very visual, which is a great design choice when it comes to his specific skillset, character art. The homepage shows most of his prominent work, with clickable pictures to take the viewer to a page about that specific piece. He discusses what the art is called/based off of, shows the model without the art textures, and what engine he used to render the model. Each word in the navigation bar has a drop-down menu that has the list of the work he has, as well as a specific page for his cover letter, resume, and contact information. The page does seem to be a little plain in its website art design with just a plain white background, but on the other hand, that is not why people are coming to his website. People want to see his work.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://darrenhorrocks.com">Darren Horrocks: Environment Art Lead</a></h2>

		<a href="https://darrenhorrocks.com"><img src="darrenhorrocks.png" alt="darrenhorrocks"></a>

		<p>Darren's website is a little easier on the eye with a grey background, which would be nicer if the viewer is looking at this at night. Unlike Lance's portfolio, Darren uses game names that are big in the industry to get viewers to click on them, which is not how I would've designed it. I believe having visuals on the home page is stronger than having game names, especially if the viewer is not familiar with all these titles. When clicking on a game title, it becomes more impressing with a description of  what his specific role was in this particular game, showing off screenshots from in-game, and non-textured/textured 3D models of the assets he worked on. His navigation bar is in the top right with 3 little bars that opens up a side panel with "Portfolio", "About", and "Contact". The contact page has a name, email, and message fill-out form for the viewer. The about page goes into detail about where he is located, a download link to his resume, a list of his skills and specialities, and clickable Twitter and LinkedIn pages.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://jasonshum.com">Jason Shum: Animator</a></h2>

		<a href="http://jasonshum.com"><img src="jasonshum.png" alt="jasonshum"></a>

		<p>Jason's website is nicely laid out with game animation reels on the homepage to watch, which is my favorite approach for a portfolio like this. The animation reels go into a lot of detail into different steps in his process on how he made each animation. Jason also showed off his recordings that showcase himself acting out the animations, which is a very helpful tool when making animations realistic from references. He has a little paragraph describing his skillset, where he works currently and previously, and advertising that he is available for freelance. He has a navigation tab specifically for his animation tutorials and another for his resume. On the far top right hand side, he has icons for all his social media. </p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/37528705/Game-Artist-Portfolio">Keith Noordzy: Game Artist</a></h2>
	
		<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/37528705/Game-Artist-Portfolio"><img src="keithnoordzy.png" alt="keithnoordzy"></a>

		<p>Keith's website's design very simplistic by having all his work on his home page, and he has a slideshow of all his work as well in case people do not want to slide down the page. It seems a bit redundant to have a slideshow of all your work AND have all that work in separate pictures right beneath it if the viewer just scrolled down a bit. He does not have a contact page or a bio page, and I had to go to his profile on Behance's website to get to that part. I feel that should be added to the portfolio itself because most employers expect that information to be part of the portfolio, especially since they do not have all the time in the world to go around searching for your contact information. Going back to his work, his art is sectioned nicely, going by each project he's worked on and showing all sprites he's worked on. Additionally, Keith does UI art that he showcases within each section respectively.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://www.oswinart.com">Oswin Neumann: CG Artist</a></h2>

		<a href="http://www.oswinart.com"><img src="oswinneumann.png" alt="oswinneumann"></a>

		<p>Oswin's portfolio has a fun layout to it with personality around every corner, which gives me a better impression of the person behind the portfolio. His navigation bar is simple with a portfolio page, blog page, bio page, and contact page. On the home page, he has a sub-navigation bar that categorizes his work into "3D asset creation", "animation game", "animation trailers", and "illustration." Right beneath the sub-navigation bar, Oswin showcases all his work with the title of the project, a screenshot of content from the project, and what each content entails (animation, 3D asset creation, etc). The "About" page includes detailed information about his current and previous work, his skillsets, and a picture of himself. The "Contact" page includes a small paragraph with his email and phone number to contact him. Lastly, the footer of his website includes social media icons and all his contact information.</p>
